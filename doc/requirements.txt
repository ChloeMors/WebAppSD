Union Data
Department of Labor union financial data: 
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/public-disclosure-room
This data from the Department of Labor lets us view and print reports filed by unions, union officers and employees, employers, and labor relations consultants for the year 2000 and after
The download page contains a guide that includes descriptions for understanding columns in each file. The data appears to be well-cleaned and organized.
We will work with the data from 2021 for our web app, which would help users find unions based on region and industry
NLRB Current Reports

This data set provides information for our page detailing labor violation cases currently filed against a given company.

Tables of all work stoppages with union, worker numbers, dates, etc. from 1993-present (XLSX)
This data set provides information for our strikes page, helping users to find ongoing protests and work stoppages in their area.
